<article>
   <p>This component is just rolling a number between 1-100 every second.</p>
   <p>It uses the <strong>begin</strong> stage of mainloop to handle the roll, because that way it can receive the timestamp, which isn't passed to the update function.</p>
   <p>This way the component only needs to keep track of the last roll's timestamp and compare it against the current timestamp.</p>
   <p>Since update only receives delta, using update would require keeping a running counter as well as an internal timestamp to compare against.</p>
